Guidelines for Presentations and Papers
---------------------------------------

In every class, all students will be responsible for a written summary of that day's research paper, and one student will be responsible for offering a presentation to lead a discussion on that paper. The main work for the course consists of coming to class having done the reading and prepared the summary.

**Discussants:**

*   Each student will be required to prepare a brief writeup (~1-2 pages) of each paper presented in class.
*   This should be prepared before the presentation and will be turned in at the end of each class.
*   The writeup should summarize the major issues addressed in the paper, the techniques used, and conclusions drawn.
*   It should also include a list of several questions and criticisms that could be used to direct discussion in class.
*   Be prepared to discuss.
*   Writeups will be graded and returned.

**Presenters:**

*   Use Powerpoint if possible.
*   Include these major headings in the presentation:
    *   Purpose/Issues
    *   Methods
    *   Results
    *   Conclusions
    *   Criticisms
    *   Further work
*   Keep it brief. (30 mins. max.)
*   Inform the TAs well ahead of time if you will not be using your own computer for the presentation and will require A/V support beyond an LCD projector.
